# Health-Bot

Health-Bot is a modular, script-driven prototype for a health assistant. The repository includes a Python entry point and supporting source folders for experimentation and packaging, along with scripts for setup/automation.

> License: MIT. Repo layout includes `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `template.py`, `test.py`, and the folders `src/`, `Healthbot/`, `research/`. GitHub’s language panel lists PowerShell, Roff, C, Batchfile, and Python. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Overview

The project is organized to support:

* a simple application entry point (`app.py`) for running the bot
* a `src/` directory for core modules
* a `research/` directory for experiments/notebooks or exploratory code
* a `Healthbot/` directory for auxiliary scripts or environment helpers
* packaging files for local installs and reuse (`setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` if added later)

This lets you iterate quickly on health-assistant logic while keeping experiments and runnable code separate. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Features

* Scriptable runner via `app.py` (CLI execution)
* Modular code organization under `src/`
* Experimentation space under `research/`
* Packaging/installation via `setup.py`
* MIT-licensed for broad reuse and adaptation ([GitHub][1])

---

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python (app + modules); repository also contains **PowerShell**, **Batchfile**, and **C** assets used for setup/automation or system tasks (per GitHub language breakdown). ([GitHub][1])
* **Structure:** `src/`, `research/`, `Healthbot/` directories, plus top-level runner and setup scripts. ([GitHub][1])
* **Packaging:** `setup.py` for editable installs/local reuse. ([GitHub][1])

> If you add specific Python libraries in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`, `nltk`, `fastapi`, etc.), they will be pulled in during installation. (The repository includes `requirements.txt`.) ([GitHub][1])

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python (version matching your local environment)
* Virtual environment recommended

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalhar108/Health-Bot.git
cd Health-Bot

python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

Run the main application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Optional test script:

```bash
python test.py
```

> Adjust flags or environment variables in your scripts as needed. The `src/` package is available once installed in editable mode.

---

## Development

* Add core modules under `src/` and import them in `app.py`.
* Keep experiments in `research/` so the production entry point remains clean.
* If you maintain helper scripts in `Healthbot/` (PowerShell/Batch), document their purpose and expected environment (Windows vs. Unix). ([GitHub][1])
* Update `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` when introducing new dependencies or packages. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Roadmap

* Define a concrete health-assistant pipeline (intent parsing, symptom triage, content retrieval, safety rails).
* Add tests under a dedicated `tests/` folder and wire into CI.
* Introduce a lightweight API or UI layer (e.g., FastAPI or Streamlit) if needed.
* Containerize for reproducible deployment (Dockerfile + compose).
* Split research assets into versioned experiments with clear results summaries.
