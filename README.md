Health-Bot

An AI-powered conversational assistant for health-related interactions and insights.

Overview

Health-Bot is designed to provide users with intelligent responses to health queries, leveraging natural language processing and conversational logic to assist with general health advice and interactions.

Features

Conversational interface for users to ask health-related questions

Natural language processing to interpret symptoms or queries

Structured back-end logic for response generation

Modular architecture enabling extension with new health scenarios

Packaging and dependency management to support reproducible builds

Tech Stack

Language: Python (core logic)

Bot Framework: Python modules handling chat interactions

Processing Modules: Natural language parsing, intent recognition, custom logic

Packaging & Build: setup.py, requirements.txt

Deployable App: Single script entry point (app.py) and supporting modules

Code Quality / Org: Modular directory layout (src/, research/, etc)

Installation
Prerequisites

Python (compatible version as indicated in setup.py or project requirements)

(Optional) Virtual environment for isolation

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kalhar108/Health-Bot.git
cd Health-Bot


Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Optionally install the package:

pip install -e .

Usage

Run the bot application:

python app.py


Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the bot and test various health-related queries.

How It Works (High-Level Flow)

User sends a query (symptom description, health question).

The bot module processes input text via parsing/intent recognition.

Based on recognized intent and context, the logic module formulates a structured response.

The response is delivered back to the user via the chat interface (console or UI).

The system logs interactions and handles errors gracefully via the modular architecture.

Design Highlights

Modular codebase: clear separation of source modules (src/), experimental work (research/), and test harness (test.py).

Simple entry point (app.py) for quick start and integration.

Packaging support (setup.py) allows for installation as a module and reuse in other projects.

Dependency lock via requirements.txt ensures reproducibility.

MIT license allows for broad reuse and adaptation.

Future Enhancements

Extend health domain knowledge base (more symptoms, conditions, modules)

Add external API integration for verified medical data

Introduce user history tracking to context-aware conversational flows

Integrate a UI front-end for richer interaction (web/app)

Add unit/integration tests for more robust coverage

Deploy to a cloud environment for real-time usage
